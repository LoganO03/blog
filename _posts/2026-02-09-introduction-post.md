This is my first post. Topics for discusion will include:
- What parts were new to me in Lab 2
- What parts did I struggle with in Lab 2
- What parts still do not make sense to me in Lab 2
- What am I most looking forward to in the course

Here is more information on [Lab 2][lab-2].

#### What Parts Are New
I have only a small amount of experience in web development from middle school, before taking this course.
So as far as what's new to me this whole lab was new. I have very little experience with Ruby and Jekyll.

#### Struggles in Setup
I did have many struggles in the setup of this blog. When working from another comuputer the installation process with Ruby was being difficult. Once moving to my main desktop and attempting installation via the command line, it worked without a hitch.
Once Ruby was installed I had another error, this being the lack of git on my comupter to work within the command line and ultimatly setup the bundler to allow the blog to work. This required a lot of trial and error, but after I got git working the blog worked well.

#### What Makes No Sense
What I am still confussed about is how the Jekyll program takes on the inputs it recives in the `.md` files, like this blog post, and transfers that information over to the `.html` format. I find it really interesting and would like to learn more about this process. 

To look more into this, I will look at the [rendering process][rendering] given in the [Jekyll documentation][jekyll-docs].

#### Looking Forward
At the current stage this blog look plain. I'm hoping we look into more about how we can create files that may make this blog look unique.
